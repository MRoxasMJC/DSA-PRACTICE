A stack is a linear data structure that strictly follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
Elements are added and removed only from one end, called the top.
The most recently inserted element is the first one to be removed.
Insertion or 1jdeletion of elements at any position other than the top is not allowed.

Common Procedures include:
* Push: add an element to the top
* Pop: remove the top element
* Peek/top: looking at the top element without removing it.

The stack is implemented in stack.h and demonstrated in stack.cpp.
